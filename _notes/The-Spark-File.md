Store every failed poem, writing line and idea in one big file to sort through later. Comb through it regularly when uninspired and see what jumps out at you. Similar to a [[Writers-Notebook]], but digital and searchable.

Ideas compost. The [[spark file]] is the compost pile where things break down and combine in new ways.

I've kept a [[spark file]] for years and it's many, many lines long. Because it's [[Plain-Text]], it's still a compact file and able to be easily searched and looked through. I have it stored as an org file in [[Emacs]] and have a function to show a random headline.

It's useful to look through years later and see the start of ideas.

-   This idea comes from <a href="https://medium.com/the-writers-room/the-spark-file-8d6e7df7ae58" >Stephen Johnson</a>

It is also an example of the [[Collectors-Fallacy]] in action, as you can store endless amounts of information and be overwhelmed by it.

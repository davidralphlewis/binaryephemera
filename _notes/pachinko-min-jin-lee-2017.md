Author: Min Jin Lee

Massive hit detailing one family over a hundred years or so as they leave Korea and live in Japan, where they are treated like second class citizens. I didn't know anything about the animosity between Japanese and Koreans so those aspects of the book were really interesting. Some parts are well done and engaging, like the central relationship between a yakusa boss and the mother, but other stories especially towards the end seemed to come and go without making much impact. Mostly thumbs up.

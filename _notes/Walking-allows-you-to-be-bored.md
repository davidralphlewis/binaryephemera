If you regularly [[Walk-without-stimulus]], it allows you to [[Be-Bored]]. Without the distraction of a podcast or music, it allows you to [[Be-Present]] in the world and engage with it more fully. In these days of distraction, boredom is increasingly rare. Therefore [[walking-can-be-meditation]] and allow you to be unstimulated for a little while.

For this reason [[Walking-is-a-powerful-tool-for-creativity]] and therefore [[Walking-is-helpful-for-your-mental-health]].

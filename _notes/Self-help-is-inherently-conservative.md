You get a lot more grifters and self help gurus on the right of the political spectrum than you do on the left. This is because self help is not about challenging the status quo or for making things better for a large amount of people. It is instead about self reliance and improving your own situation. Or to put it another way, [[Self-Help-Ignores-Systemic-Solutions]] as well as [[self-help-ignores-privilege]]  meaning the advice often becomes pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

This is explored a lot in [[If-Books-Could-Kill-Podcast]].

ay. There is a microphone (usually) and it is open to any one. Usually you have a set amount of time to perform something. There's different types, music, comedy and poetry, or all three. 

Most poetry nights are five minutes or so, but this can vary. They may have headliners which do a longer set, usually about 20 minutes.

They are great places to try [[Performing Poetry]] your work. Poetry audiences are typically very welcoming and supportive so it's a lovely place to experiment with reading things out.

In the same way as you should [[Walk-without-stimulus]], you should also try to do the washing up without listening to a podcast or music, or watching youtube (as I often do). This allows you to [[slow-down-to-pay-attention]] and [[Be-Present]].

This is advice you often see online because no-one likes doing the dishes. Yet if you pay attention to it, you find each moment expanding. I hate the dishes and yet I find if I spend the time to pay attention to it, the washing up is done better and I feel better. I don't rush through it, I take my time.

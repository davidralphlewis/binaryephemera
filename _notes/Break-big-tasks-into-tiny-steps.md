Big tasks can be overwhelming so it is important to break them down into small steps to find [[Ways-to-Focus]]. You can break them down into tiny steps so they become easy. The way to get fit for example is to break up your workout jnto managabale sets, like one push up. 

The idea is to [[Lower-the-Barrier-To-Entry]] enough so it becomes easier to [[Start-before-you-are-ready]] rather than not doing it. Remember [[Small-Changes-Add-Up]]

The last Earthsea book. I love the way Earthsea evolves and changes throughout the books, but LeGuin manages to draw on all the rich history and detailed. Ged is now an old man, content to look after his house while adventure happens elsewhere. It's tinged with the fear of death and the unknown and is such a fitting end to the series.

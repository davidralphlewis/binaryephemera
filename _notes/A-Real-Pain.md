Really well observed small film about two cousins on a holocaust tour in Poland. Intense and sad.

- Kieran Culkin is amazing as an outgoing, sensitive person with an undercurrent of sadness and depression.
- Everyone carries their own sadness around and you can never know what is going on.
- No happy ending, ends as it starts. Trip was a brief reprieve from normal life but did not change the characters.

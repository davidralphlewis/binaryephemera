[[BookNotes]] author: [[Kritika H Rao]]

Inventive, crazy fantasy about cities in the sky made of plants that can be manipulated by architects.

Good to see fantasy drawing from other traditions instead of just Western Europe.

About different states of consciousness and beings living forever in human form.

Dynamic between central married couple who are fighting. Interesting dynamic not really explored in fiction.

Climax is a bit of an info dump.

One way to stand out is to subvert expectations. Instead of doing what everyone else is doing  make the opposite. If everyone is doing short form videos, make something long. If everything is drawing inspiration from new stuff,  [[Take-inspiration-from-old-stuff]].

You should [[Copy-to-Understand-the-Rules]] then subvert them.

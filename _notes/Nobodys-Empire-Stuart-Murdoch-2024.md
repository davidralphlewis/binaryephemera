[[BookNotes]]  
author - Stuart Murdoch

A fictionalised memoir of the author's experience with ME in Glasgow in the early nineties. It's close to real life but still a novel, creating a strange hybrid of the two. Autobiography and fiction merge together.

Not much happens for obvious reasons, but it's witty and well observed throughout. The main character desires to connect with the world while being unable to due to his illness. 

His illness is not understood and frequently challenged by others, including medical professionals.

There's a passion for music throughout the book as a lifeline, a real love that becomes a way forward.

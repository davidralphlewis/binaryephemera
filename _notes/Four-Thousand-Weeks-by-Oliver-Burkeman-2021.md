[[BookNotes]] author: [[Oliver-Burkeman]]

This is an antidote to [[productivity]] books that promise ways to do more with less time. There are no life hacks in this book. Instead, Burkeman writes a philosophical treatise on what it means to live. [[You-Will-Die]] and [[Our-Lives-Are-Brief]] and limited, so [[Any-Decision-Eliminates-Others]]. The antidote to this is to [[Slow-Down]], [[Practise-Doing-Nothing]] and [[Embrace-the-Wonder-of-Being-Alive.]] 

It's a beautiful, funny but also wise book that made me reassess my relationship to [[productivity]] and stop trying to do everything. Reading it on a beach in Croatia helped of course. 

## Key Ideas

- [[You-Will-Die]] and [[Our-Lives-Are-Brief]].
- [[Be-Present]] and [[Slow-Down]]. Instead of rushing through everything, [[Let-Tasks-Take-the-Time-They-Take]]
- [[Choose-What-is-Important]] and eliminate everything else. Remember [[Any-Decision-Eliminates-Others]] so you need to narrow down what to focus on. [[set-limits-on-what-you-do]]. 
- [[Attention-is-Everything]]. Try to maintain it but remember [[Distraction-is-Inevitable]].
- [[Sit-With-Discomfort]] to make it easier to bear. Acknowledge what is difficult and [[Acknowledge-Your-Limitations]]
- [[There-Will-Always-Be-a-Gap-Between-Dreams-and-Reality]]
- [[Social-Media-is-Designed-to-Capture-Our-Attention]]. It also changes what we think is important. 
- [[Productivity-Makes-You-More-Rushed]]
- Things will always take longer than you plan.([[Hofstaders-Law]])
- [[Worry-is-an-attempt-to-control-the-future]]

## Criticisms

- Accepting life how it is can stop the desire for change. Burkeman acknowledges this within the text but I think it needs more examination, especially on a social level. This is because [[Self-Help-Ignores-Systemic-Solutions]].

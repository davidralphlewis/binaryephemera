[[Writing-is-a-way-of-externalising-our-thoughts]] of course, but more than that it's about paying attention to what is going on, whether that is in your head or in the world. It is a way to [[make-the-implicit-explicit]] in the same way you can [[explain-your-process-to-a-rubber-duck]]. By writing you chose what you pay attention to and try to articulate it in words.

This is why you should [[Re-read old diaries to pay attention and know yourself]]

> When we write, we redirect our attention. But it doesn’t stop there: precisely because we write, we redirect our attention before the act of writing, and even after it.

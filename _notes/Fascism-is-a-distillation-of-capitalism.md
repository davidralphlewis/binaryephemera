Fascism is not a separate system from capitalism, a distinct set of different rules. Instead, it is a distillation of all the ideas of capitalism, of a 'natural' order, of competition being the most important part. In [[Doppelganger-by-Naomi-Klein-2023]], Klein points out the idea of concentration camps emerged in the UK and was enthusiastically adopted by the USA before being used in the Holocaust. 

Fascism can therefore be seen as the ideas of capitalism taken to their extreme, in the same way [[Wellness-leads-to-fascism-because-of-optimisation]].

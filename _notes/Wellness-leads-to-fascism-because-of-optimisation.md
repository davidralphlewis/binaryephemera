When taken to the extreme, wellness and fitness is about improving your body and optimising every perceived flaw. It means there is a 'perfect body' and therefore, other people have imperfect bodies. 

If you follow this chain of thought, you end up with fascism, with a 'natural' hireachy. No wonder then, that a lot of Covid conspiracy theories were spread by wellness influencers. 
Remember [[Covid-was-a-conspiracy-accelerator-because-of-lack-of-control]], whereas wellness is all about complete control of the self.

Author: Samatha Schweblin translator: Megan McDowell

Strange book about Kentukis- toys of animals that are connected to the Internet and controlled by other. Someone can see you but there's no easy way to communicate back. I found the interconnected stories quite effective, leading to a rising sense of panic, even if some don't resolve all that satisfactorily. Its clearly a commentary on phone usage and surveillance and makes you feel quite unsettled.

dy as much as possible. Walking is the pace of thinking, so when you walk you allow yourself to work through issues. 

In [[Keep Going-Austin Kleon]] say "Demons hate fresh air." Walking outside is therefore a way of keeping yourself well and paying attention to your wellbeing. 

> Above all, do not lose your desire to walk: every day I walk myself into a state of well being and walk away from every illness; I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it... but by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill... Thus if one just keeps on walking, everything will be alright
> - Søren Kierkegaard

> Walking in and of itself is a way to cultivate precisely all the qualities of person-hood that seem missing from much public discourse — attention, focus, kindness, patience, persistence, tenacity, mental and physical health. 
> - [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/167/)

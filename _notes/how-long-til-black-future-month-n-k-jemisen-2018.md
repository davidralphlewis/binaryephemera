[[BookNotes]]

Author: [[N-K-Jemisen]]

Short story collection from Jemisen, including stories that were expanded on into novels later including a version of [[The-Broken-Earth-Trilogy]] and *The City We Became*.

She's great, every story is filled with more ideas than some writers get in a lifetime. Fantastic world building and moral dilemmas in such a short space.

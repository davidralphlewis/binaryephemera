[[Writing-Exercise]] 

[From Rob Walker](https://robwalker.substack.com/p/shuffle-your-senses)

> * **Identify a meaningful smell — what would it look like?**
> * **Identify a striking sight — what does it sound like?**
> * **Identify a notable sound — what might it taste like?**
> * **Identify a distinct taste — how could it feel?**
> * **Identify a specific tactile sensation — what sort of smell does it have?**
> 
> Maybe do one a day. 
> 
> Now re-arrange the senses and do it again. And again.

A interesting variation on the [[Five-Senses-Exercise]] and a way to mix up your writing

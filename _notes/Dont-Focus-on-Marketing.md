When you start [[Blogging]] you will find hundreds of articles that say how to optimise SEO or reach the widest audience. When you start making art you will also have lots of people telling you to make an Etsy store or sell your art in some way. [[dont-rush-to-monetise-your-art]]. Ignore all of them.

Focus instead on making your art. [[Focus-on-Process-not-the-end-goal]] Learn and develop as an artist, make connections with cool people and [[Share-Your-Work]].

We think meaning comes before actions, that ritual starts from a desire to mark a specific meaning or commerate an event. While this may be true for some rituals, often it is the other way around. Doing the actions of the ritual creates a meaning.

Look at Boss Morris' finger in the Spring ritual, which started as a joke, became tradition and then becomes imbued with meaning.

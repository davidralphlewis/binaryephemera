This is an idea from [[Cal-Newport]]. Keep a log of all the information you consume and when. Do you listen to podcasts when walking or washing up? Do you read random news articles when bored at work?

I did this for a couple of weeks and found I had too much to keep track of. The information was a fire hose to my face, a deluge of facts and opinion. Clearly I needed time to process and make notes on what I wanted. [[read-less-read-deeper]]

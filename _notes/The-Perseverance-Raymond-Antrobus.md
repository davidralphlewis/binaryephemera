[[BookNotes]]

Poetry collection exploring the marginalisation of D/deaf people in society as well as other poems that deal with his father. I'd read his pamphlet *To Sweeten Bitter* a few years ago and was disappointed to find some of the same poems repeated here. Still, heis a master of poetic form and these poems are mostly great.

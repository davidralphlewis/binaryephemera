Take someone's else's work, then try to copy what they do. Write in their style for a little bit. How does it feel? Does it push your work in new directions?

The point of this [[Writing-Exercise]] is not to produce a perfect imitation of another person's work, or to faithfully reproduce what they do. Instead, you will likely fail. In that failure is an interesting way of writing that will push your writing in new directions.

Remember [[Copying-is-creative]] because [[Copying-pushes-your-art-in-new-directions]].

I'd heard this advice in a lot of places, but failed to really grasp it until [[Monday Night Write club]]

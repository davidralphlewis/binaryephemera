[[Writing-is-a-way-of-externalising-our-thoughts]] of course. One way to get specific is to write long lists. These help you to order your thought and to empty your head of all the clutter, similar to [[Morning-Pages]].

10 is a good number for any subject, that will push you to think of different things. 

This idea is from [[Keep-Going-Austin-Kleon-2019]]

Instead of constantly engaging in schadenfreude, where we take pleasure in other's misfortune, we should instead engage in mitfreude, which is the active wishing of goodwill and compassion to all people.

Loving kindness meditation helps you cultivate this feeling, as does gratitude. 

I first learned about this idea in [[stillness-is-the-key-by-Ryan-Holiday-2019]]

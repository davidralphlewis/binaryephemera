You don't create art to be successful. Instead you make art to share with others. [[Art-is-communication]] but it is also a gift to others. 

This is a good way to think about why you make art. It shifts the focus from an external result back onto the work itself. 

It is mentioned in [[Keep-Going-Austin-Kleon-2019]]. 

> Don’t make stuff because you want to make money—it will never make you enough money. And don’t make stuff because you want to get famous—because you will never feel famous enough. Make gifts for people—and work hard on making those gifts in the hope that those people will notice and like the gifts. Maybe they will notice how hard you worked, and maybe they won’t—and if they don’t notice, I know it’s frustrating. But, ultimately, that doesn’t change anything—because your responsibility is not to the people you’re making the gift for, but to the gift itself.

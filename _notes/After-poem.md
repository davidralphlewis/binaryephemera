The after poem takes inspiration from another artist or writer. This can be in a similar form to a poem you have read before, or [[Ekphrastic-Writing]] where you are taking after a piece of visual art. It creates a conversation between your work and the piece that inspired it, which doesn't always have to be full of praise. An After poem can criticise and dismantle if it wants. 

The convention is to put the person it is after in italics after the title.

It's a way to [[Transform-Existing-Work]] and create something new.

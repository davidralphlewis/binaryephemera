Conspiracy theories may seem irrational and strange, but they offer a strange form of comfort. They give the story that the world is not random, that some things are out of our control, but instead there are people in charge who have orchestrated this whole thing. Similarly, the person who has discovered the conspiracy now is in a position of power and has regained control. 

[[Everything-is-a-Story]] but unfortuantly for the conspiracy theorist, [[Life-isnt-a-story]]

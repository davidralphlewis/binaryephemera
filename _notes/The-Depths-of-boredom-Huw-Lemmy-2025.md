Scrolling gives passive boredom 
We are afraid of silence and our own thoughts -[[Boredom-is-painful]]

[[Be-Bored]]
[[Walking-allows-you-to-be-bored]]

Linked to [[full-days-and-the-long-walk-craig-mod-2025]] as both are concerned with walking, intentionality and boredom. Similar in philosophy to [[Slowness as an ideal- Tommy Dixon]]

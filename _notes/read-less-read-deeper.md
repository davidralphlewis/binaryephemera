Instead of trying to [[Read-Widely]], instead focus on a few texts.[[Make-Marginalia]] in order to [[pay-attention-to-what-you-pay-attention-to]]. [[slow-down-to-pay-attention]].

Supplement your reading with articles and audio about the book. Read different analyses and see which one you agree with.

This is a very English lit approach, but it works.

[[BookNotes]] author: [[Andrew Michael Hurley]]

Set of connected folk horror short stories set in the same cursed town over many years. These were great, giving you *just* enough detail to see where the strangeness is creeping in before often finishing on an odd detail or moment of horror. It left a lot to the imagination as good horror often does. A real sense of place as well, I feel like I know what Barrowbeck is like.

Themes of [[Nature-is-an-Elder-God]] and similar to [[Lanny-Max-Porter]]

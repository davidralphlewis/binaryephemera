[[BookNotes]]  
author: [[Philip-Pullman]]

The final book in the *Book of Dust* trilogy, a follow on from [[His-dark-materials]]. I found a lot to enjoy as Pullman is one of my favourite authors, but ultimately was a little disappointed, especially in the ending. There's vivid, interesting storytelling throughout but the ending leave a lot of loose ends and sort of just finishes. It needed expansion.

For context, he was very ill while writing it and the ending was changed by the publisher.

Imagination as a field. The universe is conscious and us interacting with it maje the world come alive.

Money corrupts the soul and everything it touches, reducing people to zombies. 

For a book about stories and imagination, leaving things out was perhaps intentional, but frustrating.

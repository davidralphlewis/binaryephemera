[[film-notes]]

Really good biopic of Brian Wilson from *The Beach Boys*. Showed his control by Dr. Landy, how he was abused but contrasting this with his mental breakdown as a young man.

Refused to shy away from the darker parts of the story, unlike the santized 2024 documentary. Parental abuse, LSD, hearing voices and psychosis.

Time merges together. [[Time is an illusion]]. Similar to [[You-Dreamed-Of-Empires-Alvaro-Enrique-Translated-by-Natasha Wimmer-2024]] surprisingly, time breaking down due to hallucinogens.

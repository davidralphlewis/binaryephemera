Really good, witty and clever but full of hear. Shakespearian comedy set around the writing of Romeo and Juliet, where the writing of the play reflects the events of the play.  
  
Very Meta - Ben Affleck plays a small part but is a big actor, like his character in the play.  
  
Full of detail, Shakespearian refrences and jokes about Elizabethean era and playhouses. Catnip for an English student like me.

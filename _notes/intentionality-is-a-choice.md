Whenever you get distracted, remember that this is a choice and you can snap out of it when you want. You can choose to be intentional and focused, even if it takes a little longer to get to. [[Focus-on-what-is-in-your-control]] and [[Be-Present]], then you can turn your mind back to the task at hand.

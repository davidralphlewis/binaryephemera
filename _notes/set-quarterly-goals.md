A year is a long time. Instead of trying to set goals for the whole year, set three month goals instead. That way you can check in regularly when you do your [[Weekly-Review]] and [[Monthly-Review]].

[[set-limits-on-what-you-do]]. 3 main aims is a good limit for three months.

I believe this is the idea of *The 12 week Year*, although I haven't read it.

[[Ali-abdaal]] proposed this idea in [[Ali-Abbdal-6-habits-for-2025]]

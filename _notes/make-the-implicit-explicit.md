One of the most useful things you can do whether working in a team is to make assumptions clear and explcit. That was everyone is working from the same page and assumptions can be challenged. Its a key principle of project management as a result.

Its also what [[Journaling]] does. It gets everything out of your head and allows you to identify what is implicit. [[Writing-is-a-way-of-externalising-our-thoughts]] and making them explicit.

Its a useful principle to guide your work.

In [[Keep-Going-Austin-Kleon-2019]], Kleon argues you should [[create-a-bliss-station]]. He refers to Joseph Campbell saying bliss can be a space you enter, or it can be a certain time for yourself. It's keeping a space or time sacred to develop a [[Creative-Routine]], but doesn't necessarily need to be. It's more about having a space or time for yourself, full of things that nurture you.

It's important that it's and/or - you may snot have a set time, but you could have a set space available, even if it is only the corner of a room. Or you could be travelling and then keep to a certain time.

It's a thought that's articulated beautifully in *[A Portable Paradise](https://poetryarchive.org/poem/a-portable-paradise/)* by Roger Robinson:

> And if your stresses are sustained and daily,   
> get yourself to an empty room - be it hotel,   
 hostel or hovel - find a lamp   
 and empty your paradise onto a desk:   
 your white sands, green hills and fresh fish.

A [[Writing-Exercise]] I first encountered jn [[Monday Night Write club]].

Get a prompt like 'the ocean', then spend 5 minutes writing all the words you associate with it. For the ocean it might be wet, blue, vast etc.

Now wrote a poem without using any of the words you wrote down.

This forces you to look beyond the obvious and find new ways of describing the everyday.

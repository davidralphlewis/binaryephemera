[[BookNotes]]

Author: [[Kurt-Vonnegut]]

[[food-for-the-dead-by-charlotte-shevchenko-knight2025]] led me back onto this. It had been a few years as I last read this in my twenties. Now in my late thirties I found it full of despair at the hopelessness and pointlessness of war and slaughter. The Tralfamadorians feel like a way of coping with the indescribable horror of war. *So it goes* feels despairing, not ironic, but a grim statement of fact. 

Despite this all, I had forgotten the jokes that pepper the text, and the clarity of Vonnegut's prose. Not a sentence is wasted. 

What can I say, it's a masterpiece and every time I return to it I find something new. Should be required reading for all warmongers.

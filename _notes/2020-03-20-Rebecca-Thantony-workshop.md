[[Writing-Workshop]]

-   [[No-Right-Way-to-Be-Creative]]
- How obvious or mysterious we are. Accessible vs obscured.
-   Use [[The-Five-Senses]] for descriptions. A way into a topic
-   [[First-Draft]]- write as if no one will read it
-   2nd edit- write for everyone.
-   Shock of language
-   Sustained imagery- use same sequences of images
-   Recognise yourself in the other. To write is to be seen in your vulnerability. Offer things to the world, not yours anymore
-   Everyone has the same [[writing fears|writing%20fears]]fears</a> and limitations. All feel it and write anyway
-   [[Free-Writing]]Free write</a> if from subconscious.
    -   Take lines or images from free writes.
-   [[Poetic-form]] - space is as much the poem as the words.
-   [[Poetic-form]] reflect meaning
-   Line break changes narrative
-   End on an image on a line, avoid connectives at the end of the line
-   stanzas, change in character, scene, emotion,
-   titles shed light on what's to come
-   Performance- it's just you on stage. Let yourself feel the fear.
    -   Bring poem to life with tone, tempo etc.
-   [[Read-Writing-Aloud]] while [[Editing-A-Poem]] and get rid of words

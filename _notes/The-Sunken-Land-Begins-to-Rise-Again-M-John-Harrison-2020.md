Perhaps the closest thing I've read to [[David-Lynch]]'s films. Describing it sounds very mundane - a man meets a woman and gets a job on a barge, a woman does up her mum's house in Shropshire. It feels throughout like there's a creeping sense of menace, an unseen threat that will consume everything. There's rituals and repeated characters who speak in cryptic phrases, a Victorian novel that keeps cropping up and damp and mould and water. It hit me in the right spot, the uncanny and unknown felt like a horror novel of deep England, with no particular reveal or conclusion.

Strange, hypnotic remaining of Cortex meeting Montezuma.  While Enrique is clearly on the side of the Mexicas, he still paints the conquistadors as flawed people in a historical context and doesn't shy away from the brutality of the Mexica religion. It's full of historical detail and is clearly well researched, but takes a turn halfway through into something a lot stranger. Time and fiction start to break down.  I'm going to be thinking about this for a while.

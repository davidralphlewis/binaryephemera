[[BookNotes]] author: [[Nana-Kwame-Adjei-Brenyah]]

A *Hunger Games* style future where prisoners fight to the detah. Not subtle.
Linked back to the modern day with footnotes like [[Babel-R-F-Kuang]]

Making the point that the modern day prison system is a form of slavery and is cruel and racist.

Thurwar and Hurricane Staxx both well developed characters with different attitudes to their fate. Other characters are broken by the system.

Protest doesn't add a lot to the system but it becomes an authorial mouthpiece.

Violence becomes relentless in book. Dulls the impact.

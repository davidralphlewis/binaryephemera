To avoid procrastinating, just start something immediately and see how it goes. Don't prep anything or make any plans. Instead, before you think you are ready, start the thing. [[Have-a-bias-towards-action]] and jump in with both feet.

It's also a great way to start learning something- blunder into a subject you know nothing about and ask questions.

This way you allow your subconscious to take over, which can be scary. It also avoids the fear and you can [[Lower-the-Barrier-To-Entry]]. The aim is to avoid [[Paralysis-by-analysis]]

>  If there is a single lesson I can give you now, let it be this: do things without knowing what they will become, without expectations, and without over-planning. Just get into them. Life is more fun when it is led by curiosity.

A quote from Amy Krouse Rosenthal that neatly summarises the point of [[Journaling]], [[Meditating]], making notes in general. We use these to [[Know-Yourself]]. It's a good reason to [[reread-old-diaries-to-pay-attention-and-know-yourself]]. [[Attention-is-Everything]] so this meta attention is very valuable

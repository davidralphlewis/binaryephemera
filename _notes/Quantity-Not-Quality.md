In creative work, focus on getting lots of things done at first. Make many things, make them quick. Don't focus on perfectionism as it will never be right ([[Perfection-Doesn't-Exist-when-making-art]]) Instead, focus on finishing lots of work and getting it out of the door, so you can focus on other things ([[Focus-on-Process-not-the-end-goal]]) In this way you learn lessons from each project you finish and you accumulate knowledge quicker. [[Put-Your-Work-Out-There]] and move on.

[[film-notes]]

Very of it's time film about someone starting a high school and pretending to be popular.

Link to Vonnegut:

> We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful what we pretend to be - Kurt Vonnegut *Mother Night*

A couple of jokes that haven't aged well, casual reacism and r slur, but otherwise holds up.

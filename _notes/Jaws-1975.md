- Builds tension throughout, you don't see the shark fuly until near the end. 
- The last sequence on the boat becomes an apocalyptic parable of man vs nature, similar to *The Old Man and the Sea*.
- Same structure as a slasher flick - the threat is built up and then picks people off one by one.
- Masculinity against unknown chaos.
- Capitalism as the central enemy (apart from the shark of course). The mayour gets commuppance.

In order to prioritise [[Quantity-Not-Quality]] when making things, lower your standards. The piece of art does not have to be a masterpiece every time, it just needs to be finished. [[Lower-the-Barrier-To-Entry]] and try to finish something, instead of making it perfect.

It might mean trying to [[Make-something-bad-on-purpose]]. Remember [[Perfection-Doesn't-Exist-when-making-art]]

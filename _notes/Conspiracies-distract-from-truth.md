[[Conspiracy-theories-get-the-facts-wrong-but-the-feelings-right]]. They misdirect the anger and suspicion of the people into scapegoats. As such, they are useful for the people in charge as they divide people and cause them to start fighting amongst themselves. They also cause hate to spread. 

The theories distract from the truth - [[capitalism-is-the-villain]]. The system needs reform but those in charge have no interest in allowing this, not when they profit.

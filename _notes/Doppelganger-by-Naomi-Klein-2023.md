[[BookNotes]] author: [[Naomi-Klein]]

Naomi Klein explores the alternative right wing internet through being mistaken for Naomi Wolfe and the metaphor of dopplegangers, as well as conspiracy theories and capitalism. Unlike *The Shock Doctrine*, it didn’t tell me a lot that was new but I think she’s an interesting writer that has done a lot of research, so was worth it.

[[Focus-on-what-is-in-your-control]] is good advice, but is especially useful when thinking about a [[Creative-Routine]]. We should aim to [[Enjoy-the-creative-process]], not focus on how it will be received. To counteract this, [[Austin-Kleon]] suggests we should only focus on the daily routine, the things that can be accomplished in the day. 

This links to [[Four-Thousand-Weeks-by-Oliver-Burkeman-2021]], with the command to [[Choose-What-is-Important]] and eliminate everything else. 

Remember though

One way to overcome [[Writers-Block]] is to try and make something terrible. Write the worst, most nonsensical piece of rubbish you can, draw like a child, play with your other hand. 

The idea is to [[lower-your-standards-to-make-more]]. In this way you [[Start-before-you-are-ready]] and jump into the creative process. It also removes any pressure you put on yourself, because you are trying to make it rubbish.

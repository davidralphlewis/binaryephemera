Watched 2024  
  
Film by [[Ben Edge]] where he travels round the country, filming folklore traditions. Most are ancient but then a lot have been revivied. If a tradition is revived in the 19670's it's now a new tradition  
  
Blackface has (possibly) different origins but the context has changed now, and the racist connotations are unavoidable, regardless of internet. Traditions need to reflect the times.  
  
Traditions evolve and change throughout the years. Are adapted to circumstances. This is an inevitable part of folklore, not something to be shunned.  
  
Festivals bring community together (usually with pints)  
  
Origins of most festivals has been lost or obscured, but the actions remain.  
  
Ways of marking the year, like beltaine has linsk to spring. Marking the turning of the year.  
  
Can make a simple file with not much equipment - uses phone but his enthusiasm stays.

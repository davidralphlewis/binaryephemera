[[film-notes]] [[2025]]

Beautiful, perfect film about a millionaire inviting a folk due to an island for a private gig. 
Slowly reveals itself to be a nuanced portrait of grief.
Tim Key starts funny but is amazingly expressive.
About living in the past and being unable to move, forgetting yourself.

Author: [[Eliza-Clark]]

Loved this. A true crime retelling of a murder of a teenage girl by other teenagers. Its amazing how at the start it tells you the narrator is not to be trusted, yet you still end up believing him. A worthy critique of true crime and the voyeurism of looking af other people's horrible crimes and attempting to tell stories about them.

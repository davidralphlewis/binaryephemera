[[Art-is-Play]] and [[Art-is-a-gift]]. Therefore, according to [[Austin-Kleon]], you should not rush to monetise your work, but instead make work primarily for yourself. You may want to make a living from your art but when you are just starting out make work for yourself. [[Dont-write-to-only-please-an-audience]]

A theory from [[Craig-Mod]] that you shouldn't aim for happiness.  Instead you should aim for fullness and happiness is then a by product.

Fullness is squeezing the most out of a day, walking a lot and writing for example. Its doing deep work with your full concentration.

> What the heck is “happiness” if not a fleeting moment of peace and satisfaction; certainly not an “end state” goal in and of itself. Aim for the concrete! Fullness is easy to measure: How tired are you? How many words did you write today? How many people did you yell _hello_ to?

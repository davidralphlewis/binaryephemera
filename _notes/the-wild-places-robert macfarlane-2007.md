[[BookNotes]] author: [[Robert-Macfarlane]]

Non fiction about the author attempting to find the wildest places in the United Kingdom, sometimes accompanied by Roger Deakin. His death halfway through becomes a backdrop of grief.

MacFarlane writes incredibly well about nature, often making you feel like you are there. His wide ranging reading and comparisons to literature is basically catnip to someone like me. I also loved the ability to find wildness in the small instead of the grand, in the cracks of pavements instead of up a mountain. But I did find myself annoyed by the priveledge of the book which barely gets examined. He's able to sleep up a mountain, or leave his work and wander into the woods which not everyone can and it rankled me, whereas it hasn't before in his other books.

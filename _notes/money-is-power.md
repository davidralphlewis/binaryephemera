Money gives people access to politicians and powerful lobbying forces. Lots of money can buy influence and sway policies to be favourable towards their interests. The more money you have, the more power and influence you are likely to have.

Therefore [[the-continual-existence-of-billionaires-is-a-problem-for-society]] because they have more power than everyone else, and therefore more influence over our political system.

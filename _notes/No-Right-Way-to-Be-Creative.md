Lots of advice for writers or artists will be dogmatic, saying it is the only way to achieve your creative aims. In my experience this isn't true. There is no single way to be creative, just as there is no single way to write a book or paint a canvas. 

So try to find a [[Creative-Routine]] that works for you, remember [[all-advice-is-autobiographical]] and [[Enjoy-the-creative-process]]. Or ignore all this and find your own way.

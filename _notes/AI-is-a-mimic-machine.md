'Artificial Intelligence' as it stands is not a intelligent in any way. Instead, it mimics what is put into it and spits it out into new forms. It does not create anything new and does not understand the words or images it is producing. 

No wonder then it needs vast amounts of illegal stolen data to train the models.

If you are having problems of confidence, focus instead on what you can physically do instead of how it makes you feel. 

For running for example, you would focus on putting on trainers and leaving the house instead of thinking how unfit you are.

This is a way to [[Start-before-you-are-ready]] and avoid [[Paralysis-by-analysis]]

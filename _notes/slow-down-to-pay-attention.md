It's important to [[Slow-Down]] as it helps you pay attention and [[Choose-What-is-Important]] to you in that moment. It helps you [[Be-Present]]. If we rush around too much, we are not paying attention to anything in close enough detail ([[Productivity-Makes-You-More-Rushed]]). Therefore [[do-less-to-do-more]] and pay attention to the world around you.

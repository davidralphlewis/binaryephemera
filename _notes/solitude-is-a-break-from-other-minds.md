In [[Digital-Minimalism-Cal-Newport-2019]], Newport draws on a theory from Raymond Kethledge and Michael Irwin that solitude is not just being alone, but is instead freeing yourself from the input of other minds. You can be alone but still connected to others by your phone, or by reading.

Solitude is instead taking a [[Walk-without-stimulus]] or [[Meditating]]. Or doing nothing for a bit. [[solitude-allows-us-to-hear-our-own-thoughts]].

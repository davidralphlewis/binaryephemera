[[BookNotes]]

Author: [[N-K-Jemisen]]

Jeminsen throws a million ideas at the wall in her fantasy but they aways create unique and interesting settings. This is no exception, with a ruling class using gods as weapons  and the gods resentment to this. Goes fast and looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy. Do slightly prefer [[The-Broken-Earth-Trilogy]] however.

[[source-notes]] on the exhibition by [[Stanley-Donwood]] and [[thom-yorke]] of [[Radiohead]] at the Ashmolean in Oxford in 2025

- Big influence on me. Was a delight to see the original large scale artworks, notebooks, gestation of ideas. Big emphasis on process without expecting results ([[Focus-on-Process-not-the-end-goal]])
- Collaborative work between both artists - building on ideas between each other but not precious- allow the other to destroy or completely alter parts. 
- [[see-restrictions-as-games]] - eg. don't use undo function when making a digital image. ([[Restrictions-Make-You-More-Creative]]) 
- Music informs the art and art informs the music.
- Throw out loads of ideas and something might stick - [[Quantity-Not-Quality]]
- [[embrace-accidents-when-making-art]] or chaos - *In Rainbows* was due to an accidental oil spill.

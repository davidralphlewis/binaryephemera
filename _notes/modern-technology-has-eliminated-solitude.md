If we say [[solitude-is-a-break-from-other-minds]] then modern technology has effectively eliminated this. We are constantly able to listen to podcasts or music, or watch videos from people around the world. We do not have many moments where we allow ourselves to [[Be-Bored]].

The answer of course is to put down devices for a bit, disconnect as [[solitude-allows-us-to-hear-our-own-thoughts]].

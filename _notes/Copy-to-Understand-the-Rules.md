When you are first starting to create things in a different medium, try copying what famous creators and artist have done before you. How did Keats write a [[Sonnet]]? How did Magrite paint his surreal images? Try copying what they did. [[Copy-techniques-not-phrases]]

This is a good way to understand the agreed upon rules of a medium. You can then go onto subvert them.

Remember [[Originality-Doesnt-Exist]] and [[Copying-is-creative]].

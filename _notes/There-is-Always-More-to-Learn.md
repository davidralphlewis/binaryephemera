We should always bear in mind that the sea of knowledge is deep and near infinite. 

There's always more to discover and find out and you should never think you have all the answers. I used to think this was depressing as you would never get full answers to things but in a way it's inspiring as there's always more to challenge your worldview. [[no-one-has-all-the-answers]].

Knowing this, remember [[real-intellectualism-is-humble]]

> I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.
> - Isaac Newton

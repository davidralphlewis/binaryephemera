[[BookNotes]] 

Author: [[david-wong]]

Dumb horror novel that thinks it's smarter than it is. The sequel to *John Dies at the End*, this is a lot more structured and better written than the first book, dealing with a zombie/ day of the body snatchers style outbreak. Fun in places but not necessarily a hard recommendation.

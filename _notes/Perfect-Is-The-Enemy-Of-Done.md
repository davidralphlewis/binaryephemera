Don't try to make creative work perfect because it will never be finished. Use the [[70-percent-rule]] to ensure you're mostly happy with it, then finish the work and move onto something else.

Remember [[Perfection-Doesn't-Exist-when-making-art]]. [[your-job-is-to-add-to-the-pile]]

[[Put-Your-Work-Out-There]] and move onto the next project

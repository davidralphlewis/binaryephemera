Often, far right tactics are calculated to take advantage of where the left fails. In [[Doppelganger-by-Naomi-Klein-2023]], Klein explores how Steve Bannon focuses on areas of unity between different groups, which the left may have failed at. She identifies the focus on marginalised groups, which alienates working class white men and women, and how Bannon focuses on these groups. 

The far right, therefore, exploits any gaps in tactics from the left in order to stay ahead.

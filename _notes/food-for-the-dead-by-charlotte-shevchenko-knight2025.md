[[BookNotes]]

Author: Charlotte Shevchenko Knight

Dealing with her family history in Ukraine and the years of starvation and war, this is visceral, powerful poetry. Found it very moving and very impressive- there's a consistency of imagery and tone throughout. The longest poem, *A Timeline of Hunger* goes back in time throughout the last hundred years and is incredible. That and the last poem, where time moves backwards, reminded me of [[Slaughterhouse-Five-Kurt-Vonnegut-1970]], with a similar feeling of despair and rage. Really recommend this collection, even if you usually don't like poetry.

Creating art is embarrassing. You are taking your innermost thoughts and feelings and translating them into the world ([[Art-is-Always-Translation]]). In order to continue making things, you need to not worry about being embarrassed, as this will affect the art you make. 

Remember [[The-creator-owes-the-audience-nothing]] and [[Perfection-Doesn't-Exist-when-making-art]]

[[BookNotes]] Various authors
  
This was a great premise - authors were paired with researchers at CERN and then they wrote a story based on the research. In execution though it didn't really work for me. There was a tendency to literalise the discoveries instead of be fully imaginative, so many of the stories feature researchers at CERN instead of taking the research elsewhere. It felt quite insular as a result. A couple of the stories had some imagination and inspiration in them and they were the highlights.

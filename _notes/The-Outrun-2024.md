Beautiful film about recovery and addiction, dealing with an alcoholic who returns to Orkney to recover.

About the healing power of nature.

The stark empty landscape of Orkney is contrasted with the urban sprawl of London.

Amazing performance by Saroise Ronan.

Similar to *Hevay Metal* but more focused on the slow recover. A day at a time.

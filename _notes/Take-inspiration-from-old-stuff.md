We all know that [[Copying-pushes-your-art-in-new-directions]] and you should [[Control-your-Input-for-Better-Output]]. But if everyone is paying attention to the new stuff the output starts to be similar.

That is why you should [[identify-a-trend-and-do-the-opposite]]. Instead of focusing on what is new  read old books. Look at old art. Try to see what is special about them and go in new directions with your inspiration.

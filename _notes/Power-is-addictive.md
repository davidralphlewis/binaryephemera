There's no evidence for this, but I have noticed how leaders will do anything to stay in their position, as if having power over people is addictive. Usually it is beyond monetary reward (although [[money-is-power]]) or achievements, it seems like they are addicted to the status. Dictators will cling to power long after it becomes necessary, normal politicians will do anything to be re-elected.

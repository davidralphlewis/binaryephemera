We all know [[Walking-is-helpful-for-your-mental-health]] as it forces you to [[Slow-Down]]. [[Austin-Kleon]] suggests another reason it is helpful is because it forces you to [[Be-Present]]. Instead of dealing with an imagined world full of danger and suspicion, you are forced to deal with the world how it actually is.

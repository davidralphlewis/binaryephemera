A way of deflecting accusations that your opponent is throwing at you is to accuse them of the same thing. You are mirroring thier accusation and in the process muddying the water of the debate. 

In [[Doppelganger-by-Naomi-Klein-2023]], Klein points out Trump is a master of this tactic, often accusing his opponent of a crime that he has committed before they can accuse him.

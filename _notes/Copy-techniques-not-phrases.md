When you [[Copy-to-Understand-the-Rules]], try not to make an exact replica of the original. You won't be able to anyway. Instead, copy the technique the artist is using.

During [[Monday Night Write club]] we used an Alice Oswald poem as a guide. Instead of copying the subject matter and phrases, we tried to write in the style of Oswald. This works because [[Copying-pushes-your-art-in-new-directions]].

This is a whole genre called an [[After-poem]].

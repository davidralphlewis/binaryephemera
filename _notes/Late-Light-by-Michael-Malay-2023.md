[[BookNotes]] author: [[Michael Malay]]

Nature writing about an obsession with strange creatures- eels, moths, mussels and crickets- and what their decline means for the wider ecosystem. I really enjoyed this because Malay’s writing is beautiful, linking disparate ideas together effortlessly. There’s also a sense of sorrow and a plea to do things better, linked with the political commentary that runs through the book. It also helps he talks a lot about Troopers Hill, near where I lived in Bristol so I can picture kit. Really recommended, reminded me of [[Robert-Macfarlane]] in places.

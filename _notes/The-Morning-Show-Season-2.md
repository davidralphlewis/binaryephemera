Slightly less focused than  [[The-Morning-Show-Season-1]], this season covers the start of Covid and the aftermath of a scandal. It complicates the original series and characters more.

It took a little while to get going but the second half is incredibly powerful, with arguments erupting everywhere. There's difficult questions with no real answers. What's lacking a little is the interrogation of how structures contribute to ongoing abuses which the first series explored more.

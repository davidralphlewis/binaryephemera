An intense, thoughtful film about the power of ritual and how it can be removed so easily. 

Full of subtle acting and a series of Chekov's guns that all get fired throughout the film. Each one erodes the conventions of the church until the final, genuinely shocking twist that would destroy the church in real life.

Contrasts the belief in ritual and heresies with the belief in God itself.

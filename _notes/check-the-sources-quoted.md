With any claim, it's important to check the sources people quote. They may not back up what the person says. They may have exaggerated the claim. It may not have anything to do with the point being made at all, or it may be misleading in other ways. 

Sources are quoted for authority but they aren't always right. [[cite-your-sources]] when writing and make sure you know what they say. [[you-might-be-wrong]].

[[source-notes]] on a theatre production at the RSC [[2025]]

A condensed, kinetic version of Hamlet, with music from *[[Hail to the Thief]]* by [[Radiohead]] woven throughout it with a live band.

- Ophelia and Hamlet both young and impetuous, which is the way it should be in my opinion. Made the tragedy seem more immediate.
- Play is an all consuming meditation on grief and depression, how they stop action. [[Hamnet-Maggie-O-Farrell-2020]] really emphasises this as well.
- Music weaves together perfectly in different moments, such as Ophelia singing *Sail to the moon* and the repeated refrain of *2+2=5*.
